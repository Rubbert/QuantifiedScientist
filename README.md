# The Quantified Scientist

Here I share some of the scripts I used for my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/TheQuantifiedScientist

## Getting Started

For now I just posted some of the rough code I used. I did not intend for this code to be used by anyone else (so I hope you like spaghetti code ;-) )

### Prerequisites

I mostly code in R, and often you might need some R packages, that I might sometimes have forgotten to load in the functions themselves

One commonly used one:
```
library(ggplot2)
```
